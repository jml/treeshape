treeshape allows you to quickly make file and directory structures on disk.

For example::

    from treeshape import make_tree

    make_tree('.', [
        'logs/',
        ('README', "A simple directory layout\n"),
        ('data/input', "All of our input data\n"),
        ])

Will create a directory structure that looks like this::

    $ find .
    .
    ./logs
    ./data
    ./data/input
    ./README
    $ cat README
    A simple directory layout
    $ cat data/input
    All of our input data

This is particularly useful for tests that touch the disk.
